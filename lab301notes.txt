git clone -- given a url it makes a local copy of a rep
git branch -- allows us to keep code seperated based on what we are 
trying to develop
git branch -a -- shows us the existing branches on our repository
git remote -v --shows us the url/repository that our current repo is aware of
git add -- lets us add new files to be tracked by git to our repo
git commit -a -- saves all of our changes on the local computer into a thing
called a commit. A commit is a set of changes
git commit file1 file2 ... -- commits only specific files to our local branch
git push -- this will send our local commits to our default remote git service (eg github)
git pull -- check the remote server for new commits. If there are, then this command will fetch (git fetch) and then it will merge the new changes with
our local branch (git merge)
